Weather API
# Description
The Weather API calls a number of APIs from the Openweathermap.org open source APIs. Through exhuastive back and forth, we were able to pull the location, date, weather info at the present, and weather info for the upcoming 5 days using the API.  We set that info into cards on our main page, created a functional search bar, and created buttons that stored the info from the searches, though a bit chaotically.  Addition styling to be done, but functionality is just about there. To see stored cities, you must refresh page.  Will fix in later version. Worked with Eliezer Pagan, Brian Arsenault, and particularly closely with Mark Loercher.
